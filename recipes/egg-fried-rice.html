    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Egg fried rice has Chinese origins; like the Philippines, China has a bunch of different fried rice recipes of its own. This variant of fried rice may be one of, if not the most basic. However, what it lacks in grandeur it makes up for in its colorful appearance, inviting smell—and phenomenal taste! If you’re looking for a timeless yet creative way to spin your leftover rice, this dish is truly the way to go.</p>
